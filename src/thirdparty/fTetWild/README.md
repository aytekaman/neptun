# Fast Tetrahedral Meshing in the Wild
<!-- ![](docs/teaser.png) -->



## Important Tips

ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ **If you are interested in the algorithm details, please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03581) first. We provide plenty of examples and statistics in the paper.**

ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ **Check our license first.**

ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ **Our algorithm is robust both in theory and in practice. If you do find fTetWild crash (on your laptop), please test it (on cluster) with more resource given. The most complex model I tested requires >32GB memory.**

ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ **The orientation of input faces is as important as the position of their vertices. Our algorithm is faithful to the input face position and orientation [check Tetwild](https://github.com/Yixin-Hu/TetWild#important-tips)**

## Installation via CMake

Our code was originally developed on MacOS and has been tested on Linux and Windows. We provide the commands for installing fTetWild in MacOS:

- Clone the repository into your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wildmeshing/fTetWild.git
```

- Compile the code using cmake (default in Release mode):

```bash
cd fTetWild
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

You may need to install `gmp` before compiling the code. You can install them via

- [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on mac:
```bash
brew install gmp
```
- Package manager on Unix:
```
sudo apt-get install gmp
```
- [Conda](https://anaconda.org) on Windows:
```
conda install -c conda-forge mpfr
```

- Check the installation:

```bash
./FloatTetwild_bin --help
```
This command should show a list of fTetWild parameters.

## Usage

### Input/output Format

The inputs of our software are triangle surface meshes in `.off/.obj/.stl/.ply` format.

We support `.mesh/.msh` format output. The default output format is `.msh` with minimum dihedral angle recorded as element scalar field, which can be visualized by software [Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/). You can use `PyMesh::MshLoader` and `PyMesh::MshSaver` in `pymesh/` for read and write `.msh` meshes.


### Features
Our software is quite easy to use. Basically, users only need to provide a surface triangle mesh as input and our mesher would output a tetrahedral mesh by using default settings. If you want to customize your own tetmeshes, we also provide some options.

- Envelope of size *epsilon*

Using smaller envelope preserves features better but also takes longer time. The default value of *epsilon* is *b/1000*, where *b* is the length of the diagonal of the bounding box.

- Ideal edge length

Using smaller ideal edge length gives a denser mesh but also takes longer time. The default ideal edge length is *b/20*

- Filtering energy

Our mesher stops optimizing the mesh when maximum energy is smaller than filtering energy. Thus, larger filtering energy means less optimization and sooner stopping. If you do not care about quality, then give a larger filtering energy would let you get the result earlier. The energy we used here is conformal AMIPS whose range is from 3 to +inf. The default filtering energy is 10.

ðŸ’¡ We suggest not to set filtering energy smaller than 8 for complex input.

- Maximum number of optimization passes

Our mesher stops optimizing the mesh when the maximum number of passes is reached. The default number is 80.

- Smoothing open regions

Our method can fill gaps and holes but the tetmesh faces on those parts could be bumpy. We provide users an option to do Lapacian smoothing on those faces to get a smoother surface.

### Command Line Switches
Our software supports usage via command line or via a C++ function wrapper. Here is an overview of all command line switches:
